# hello-github
Yes!  It is the tutorial project!
This is my first Github project.  I hope to use Github to publish some open source code that I am developing!  However, that is a bit in the future.
I live in The Netherlands, but I'm an Irishman who was born in the UK and holds a UK passport.  March 29th 2019 will be interesting.  Okay.  Reset.  October 31st 2019 will be interesting.
